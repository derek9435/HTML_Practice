# HTML_Practice
Some old HTML files I did a year back

This program, Calculator.html, uses html text input fileds and javacript dom objects to minic calculator to do:
. add
. subtract
. multiply
. divide

## How it works
Open the Calculator.html in a bowser, enter the first number and second number, 
then click one of the button of +, -, *, /, then calculation result will display.

## Languages
HTML and JavaScript are used. JavaScript callback function was coded to respond to 
the click button of +, -, *, or / to get the html input through Dom objects and 
do the calculation.
