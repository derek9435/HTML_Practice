# HTML_Practice
Some old HTML files I did a year back

This program, Calculator.html, uses html text input fileds and javacript dom objects to minic calculator to do:
* add
* subtract
* multiply
* divide

## How it works
Open the Calculator.html in a bowser, enter the first number and second number, 
then click one of the button of +, -, *, /, then calculation result will display.

## Languages
HTML and JavaScript are used. JavaScript callback functions were coded to respond to 
the click on one button of +, -, *, or /, respectively to get the html inputs through DOM objects and 
do the calculation.
